[![hackmd-github-sync-badge](https://hackmd.io/mRY5kBvuQMK1BE0AlQs9UA/badge)](https://hackmd.io/mRY5kBvuQMK1BE0AlQs9UA)


There are a few things to test out, 
- [ ] Integration with github
- [ ] How to make it a notebook with many tabs
- [ ] If we should start adding our content here
- [ ] How to include comments here


##    Could be interesting:
- to share our research report in this way
- See if there needs to be an integration with jupyter noteboook
